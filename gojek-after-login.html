                        About the Role</br>
                        If you’re looking to be a part of a dynamic, highly-analytical team who enjoys creating strategy based on available data, look no further. As our District Operation Staff for the Indonesia Region team, 
                        you will be handed the reins in overseeing the supply management for Gojek. Along with the district team, you will be in charge of the operational driver spectrum within the district level, which includes 
                        balancing supply and demand (BCR), utilizations, driver acquisitions, driver engagements, and solving driver problems on the field. Working closely with the Regional Strategy team, you will even get to localize 
                        the HQ strategy that matches the nature of the district. Perhaps the most meaningful of all: your efforts will work to enhance the lives and livelihoods of our driver partners in the region, providing them with the 
                        attention, experience, and opportunities they deserve.</br></br>

                        What You Will Do</br>
                        - List, identify, and propose solutions to our driver partners' problems on the field and ensure their concerns are heard by following up with them</br>
                        - Manage offline engagement (i.e. 'kopdar') as our way to inform, reach, and engage with driver partners</br>
                        - Ensure all engagement programs are well executed and implemented</br>
                        - Handle driver support unit according to agreed operating office hours</br>
                        - Support implementation of Gojek's policies/programs by managing these changes</br>
                        - Propose activities/programs to engage our driver partners</br>
                        - Monitor personal metrics of engagement with driver partners, and propose solutions to increase the level of engagement</br></br>

                        What You Will Need</br>
                        - A Bachelor's degree (fresh graduates are welcome to apply!)</br>
                        - At least 1 year of experience in supply chain, preferably at a multinational company</br>
                        - Strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills to effectively resolve driver-related issues</br>
                        - Strong interpersonal skills in order to cater and build relationships with various stakeholder</br>s
                        - Excellent written & verbal communication skills focused on improving collaboration, understanding, and information exchange across all stakeholders</br>
                        - Sharp attention to detail to increase productivity and reduce the likelihood of errors</br>
                        - Excellent planning and organizational abilities to ensure the district team is on track to achieve its goals</br>
                        - An understanding about/familiarity with the South Jakarta region</br></br>

                        About the Team</br>
                        Our District Operations team is a big family spread out across multiple regions in Indonesia. Working alongside the Product team, we are predominantly concerned with all things to do with our driver-partners - 
                        their experiences using our services, their life cycle, their engagement with the company, and growing our driver partner family in the district, just to name a few things. We also oversee the supply within
                        Gojek, including creating detailed business analyses, outlining problems, and developing solutions for our driver-partners.</br></br>
                        
                        One of the biggest challenges our team has had to face has undoubtedly been maintaining a high level of engagement with our driver-partners amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure our driver-partner ties remain </br>
                        strong with the company, we introduced online meet-ups and forums with our driver-partners where they can openly discuss their questions, concerns, and experiences directly with our team.</br></br>
                        
                        Our team genuinely enjoys what we do since we get to see the impact of our work reflected in our driver-partners' everyday lives on the field. We're a fun group made up of avid readers, amateur gamers,</br>
                        Netflix watchers, K-pop listeners, and (guilty) reality show watchers. We're also big foodies, since we're spoiled for choice here in Indonesia (food recommendations are always welcome!).</br></br>
                        
                        About Us</br>
